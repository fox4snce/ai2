# Notice

This project is intentionally designed to keep intelligence:

- local
- auditable
- deterministic
- affordable for individuals and small teams

It exists to show that modern AI systems do **not** need to be
token-hungry, opaque, or controlled by centralized services.

## Why this license exists

Individuals, researchers, nonprofits, and small companies should be able
to use and learn from this system freely.

Large corporations, however, extract disproportionate value from open
technical work while contributing little back. This license is meant to
rebalance that relationship.

If your organization derives significant value from this project and has
the resources to do so, you are expected to contribute financially.

## What this is *not*

- This is not anti-AI
- This is not anti-business
- This is not an attempt to restrict learning or experimentation

It *is* an attempt to keep advanced tooling accessible without allowing it
to be strip-mined by companies that can easily afford to pay.

## If you’re unsure

If you’re not sure whether your use falls under the free-use threshold,
reach out. The goal is clarity, not gotchas.
